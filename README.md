# NLP_SAD

This project has been chosen as the final project for Chris Manning's CS224n: NLP with Deep Learning.
The goal of this project is to analyze the effect seasonal depression has on people, based on their tweets. Right now, the data has been gathered from 20 Persian-speaking users on twitter, from the beginning of winter till the end of Spring. I'm hoping to expand this timeframe for more accurate alaysis.
